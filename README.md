# Meeting room application


#Application build

To build an application just invoke build.sh

#Run application

To run this application just to invoke run.sh script file.


#NOTE

Please be sure, that java and maven have already installed.


#Additional note

I have chosen to not use database logic and cache mechanism logic. Instead each call uses only on the working hours provided in the request.
Thus it becomes unnecessary to make dependencies between request calls
