# Meeting room application


#Application build

To build an application just invoke build.sh

#Run application

To run this application just to invoke run.sh script file.


#NOTE

Please be sure, that java and maven have already installed.


#Additional note
First of all I thought to implement this application with database logic and cache mechanism logic _, after reading description many times_ I ve got then, that this is unnecessary, *cause* it will be just one call, based on the office working hours. Hence _it does not make any sense_ to make dependencies between request calls also.
