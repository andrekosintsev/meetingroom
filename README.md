# Meeting room application


#Application build

To build an application just invoke build.sh

#Run application

To run this application more then enough just to invoke run.sh script file.


#NOTE

Please be sure, that java and maven have already installed.


#Additional note

First of all I thought to implement this application with database logic and cache mechanism logic, after reading description many times I ve got then, 
that this is unnecessary, cause it will be just one call, based on the office working hours. Hence it does not make any sense to make dependencies 
between request calls also.
